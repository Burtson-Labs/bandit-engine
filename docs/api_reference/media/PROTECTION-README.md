# üõ°Ô∏è Protection System Quick Reference

## For Developers Working on This Project

### Recommended Pre-Publish Checklist
```bash
npm run protect             # Apply headers/fingerprints to any new files
npm run validate-protection # Confirm the protection suite is clean
```

Run these after feature work and before tagging a release to keep compliance tooling up to date.

### Individual Commands:
- `npm run protect` - Apply/update license headers and fingerprints  
- `npm run validate-protection` - Check for violations

### Advanced Protection:
- Additional automation (stealth fingerprints, honey pots) is handled inside the protection scripts. No extra commands are required for day-to-day development.

### Full Documentation:
- **[PRE-PUSH-CHECKLIST.md](./PRE-PUSH-CHECKLIST.md)** - Complete step-by-step guide
- **[PROTECTION-NOTICE.md](./PROTECTION-NOTICE.md)** - Legal notice for users
- **[LICENSE](./LICENSE)** - Full BUSL 1.1 license text

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Always re-run `npm run protect` and `npm run validate-protection` before publishing.

## üïµÔ∏è Advanced Protection Features

Our protection system includes multiple layers:

1. **Visible License Headers** - Obvious copyright notices
2. **Smart Fingerprints** - Content-based tracking that's hard to remove
3. **Stealth Fingerprints** - Hidden in normal-looking code comments
4. **Honey Pot Files** - Look critical but are license validation traps
5. **Runtime Validation** - Checks for license compliance at runtime

**The Goal**: Make it so annoying to remove protection that it's easier to buy a license!
