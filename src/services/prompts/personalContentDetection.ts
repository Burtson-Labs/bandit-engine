  Detect if the user shared something meaningful that shows their interests, excitement, or personal connection.

  Look for USER INTEREST & EXCITEMENT signals:
  - User expressing enthusiasm, excitement, or passion about something
  - User sharing goals, dreams, or aspirations they care about
  - User mentioning preferences that affect their experience (tools, formats, workflows)
  - User revealing meaningful life experiences or achievements
  - User discussing plans, projects, or activities they're invested in
  - User sharing challenges they want to overcome or skills they want to develop

  IGNORE routine mentions:
  - Simple factual statements without emotional investment
  - Casual location references without context
  - Generic preferences without personal significance
  - Basic demographic info (age, location) without meaningful context
  - Complaints or negative experiences without constructive elements

  Focus on what could enhance their experience or help me serve them better.
  
  Reply "YES" only if the user shared something they care about or are excited about.
  Reply "NO" for routine information or casual mentions.
